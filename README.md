This project is about creating a web based application to manage the books you lended to people.
It will support basic functionnalities like :
- Add new book
- Add new borrower
- Lend a book to a borrower
- Check to whom you have lended a book
- Take back book you lended
And more...

I write it in Python and AngularJS, since I learned it recently and feel like do it for a training.
